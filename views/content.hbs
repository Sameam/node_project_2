      <p>Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods 
        for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. <br>
        Statistics are very important in our modern worlds: </p>

                        <p>Basic Statistics is mainly about doing descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is one part of statistics that 
                            involves organizing, describing and displaying data. It is mainly about finding the central tendency of the data and 
                            data variability. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>1.1. Central Tendency</h3>
                        <p>There are 3 main ways of measure data central tendency includes mean, median and mode.
                            <ul class="box">
                                <li><b>Mean</b> sometimes often called average. To find the mean, you need to take the whole set of data and the summation of the data.
                                    After that, divide the sum by the number of each data that are in the dataset <br>
                                    For example: Find the mean of the following dataset:
                                    56,35,45,67,12,24,48,55,58,30 <br><br>

                                    <b>Median</b> is the middle number in the whole dataset. In order to find median, we will need to sort data in ascending orders.<br>
                                    If the data is odd number: 56,35,45,67,12,24,48 <br><br>
                                    = 12, 24, 35, 45, 48, 56, 67 <br><br>

                                    If the data is even number: 56,35,45,67,12,24,48,55 <br><br>

                                <li><b>Mode</b> is the data that have the highest frequency <br><br>

                        </p>
                        <h3>1.2 Data variability</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are 2 main ways to calculate the data variability, which are range and variance (or standard deviation). 
                            <ul class="box">
                                <li><b>Range</b> is the most straight forward and simplest to understand in measuring variability. The range of the dataset is the 
                                    dataset is the difference between minimun and maximum in the data. Therefore, we need to sort the data into asecending order. <br><br>
                                    For example: Find the range for dataset:20,21,22,25,26,29,33,34,38 <br>
                                    Range = 38 -20 = <br>
                                    <button onclick="range()">Show Answer</button>
                                    <p id="range"></p>
                                    The bigger the range, the more variability the dataset is. However, range is simple and based on 2 numbers which makes it susceptible to outliers. It is also not a good idea 
                                    to use range to compare 2 dataset with different sample size. <br><br>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Variance</b> which is the sqaured of standard deviation, is the average sqaured difference from mean. Unlike range, variance includes all value and compare to mean.
                                    To calculate this statistic, you calculate a set of squared differences between the data points and the mean, sum them, and then divide by the number of observations. 
                                    Hence, it’s the average squared difference. Moreover, the way you calculate the variance are different between population variance and sample variance.
                                    For example, For example: Find the variance of the following dataset:
                                    56,35,45,67,12,24,48,55,58,30, mean= 43 <br><br>

                            For qualitative data: we usually will use bar plot.

                                    Histogram is better way to show continous data such as weight of a person, height of a person and how much time. <br>

                                    also be checked by calculating the correlation between the two dataset. Moreover, having a strong relationship does not mean that X variable cause Y variable or Y variable causes X variable.

                        <p>
                            To begin learning combination and permutation, firstly, we will need to know what is combination and permutation and what is the 
                            different. <br>
                            Combination and Permutation is the various ways in which objects from a set maybe selected generally without replacement to form a subset. This selection of a 
                            subset called premutation when the order is considered. A combination when an order is not factor. 
                            There are basically two types of permutation:
                            <ol class="box">
                                <li><b>Reptition</b> is allowed. They are easy to calculate. 
                                    For example, when thing has n different type, we have n choices each time!. 
                                    Choosing 3 of those things， the permutation are n * n * n 
                                    Therefore, it is easier to write down using an exponent of r: n<sup>r</sup>. 
                                    where n is the number of things to choose from, and we choose r of them, repetition is allowed, and order matters.

                                    <b>Permutation without repitition</b>. In this case, we have to reduce the number of choice available each time. In order to calculate, 
                                    we can used factorial function !. Factorial is just function used to multiply a series of number in descending order. 
                                    The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is determined by the following formula: <br>
